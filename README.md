# The Ins and Outs of ArcGIS Data Analysis [Video]
This is the code repository for [The Ins and Outs of ArcGIS Data Analysis [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/scalable-data-analysis-python-dask-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789808926), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
ArcGIS provides a scalable framework for implementing GIS solutions for a single user or many users on desktops, in servers, over the web, and in the field. Analyzing spatial data has now become simpler than ever with ArcGIS 10.5x, a major release that comes with many new capabilities with regard to its server and cloud capabilities.

In this course, you will start by learning how to analyze spatial data in ArcGIS Desktop. You will learn to work with the basics of coordinate systems and map projections, as well as vector overlays in ArcMap. Next, you will learn how to create your own data sets. At times you will come across the need to work with datasets that do not already exist in online dictionaries. You will learn how to make new datasets and edit them as well as geo referencing existing datasets in ArcMap. Finally you will be taught how to model continuous phenomena or land use by using raster data. You will learn how to work with raster data in ArcMap, as well as functions for modeling landscape characteristics and land use change.

By the end of this video tutorial, you will know how to work with different types of data for modeling your maps in ArcGIS.
